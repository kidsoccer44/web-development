						<p class="info">
							this was a game that me and a whole group of people worked on. it is about batteling a principle because he took your phone and you are trying to retrieve it back. the whole game is controlled by buttons. once you 
							defeat someone then a button is available to be pressed while others are disabled. the cool thing that the group added was the random attack. the random attack grabs a random number between 9 and 25 and it
							does that amount of damage. another thing we added was a dropdown menu for purchasing items. it is useful when in the middle of fights, and finally my special touch was that i added CSS to make it look better,
							and better fit the theme.
							<br/><br/>
							what i learned from this experience was:<br/><br/>
							1) functions and how to use them<br/><br/>
							2) learned how to enable and disble buttons<br/><br/>
							3) learned lots about if statements <br/><br/>
							4) working and sharing ideas with teammates <br/><br/>

							you can take a look at the HTML and javascript <a href="pics/The HTML.txt">here</a> and the CSS <a href="pics/The CSS.txt">here</a> <br/><br/>
							not too bad for our first time at a text based javascript game.

						<p class="info">
							This was a game that me and a whole group of people worked on. It's about battling a principle because he took your phone and you are trying to retrieve it back. The whole game is controlled by buttons. Once you 
							defeat someone then a button is available to be pressed while others are disabled. The cool thing that the group added was the random attack. The random attack grabs a random number between 9 and 25 and it
							does that amount of damage. Another thing we added was a dropdown menu for purchasing items. It is useful when in the middle of fights, and finally my special touch was that i added CSS to make it look better,
							and better fit the theme.
							<br/><br/>
							What I learned from this experience was:<br/><br/>
							1) Functions and how to use them<br/><br/>
							2) Learned how to enable and disble buttons<br/><br/>
							3) Learned lots about if statements <br/><br/>
							4) Working and sharing ideas with teammates <br/><br/>

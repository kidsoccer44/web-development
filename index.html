						<h2>Javascript</h2>
							<p>
								javascript a language that i sort of know of. i started learning javascript in late 2017 for my voTech class. with
								the basics of this language i made a simple calculator using lots of input boxes and functions, a game based on 
								buttons for buying resources and fighting and a very simple number guessing game. so far javascript is not my top
								priority but i do plan on learning more of its capabilities in the future

						<h2>HTML and CSS</h2>
							<p>
								HTML and CSS is something i am more comfortable with. i have been practincing and learning HTML and CSS
								for that last 6+ months. i am no expert but i am i bit advance in this. although i have practiced and used 
								this for a while i still have a lot to learn for me to be considered an expert in this.

						<h2>Python</h2>

					  <div class="grid-item">
						<h2>GML</h2>
							<p>
								GML stands for game maker language. this languague is used in gameMaker studio 2 to make games. i started
								to learn GML at the beginning of 2017 and i am frequently using it in my game design class. this language resembles
								alot like javascript. it has most if not all the javascript functionality and more just for game purposes such as functions
								specifically designed for the sprites and the game rooms. i do know the basics and can build a basic game like an areana shooter
								or a simple platformer. i still need more practice and studying to get better.

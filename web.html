						This is it. This is one of my proudest projects to date and probably forever. This shows me that anything in life I want to do I can do. It may not look like much but I worked hard on it and it came out 
						better than expected. And to me, that's all that matters. Months of studying and getting to know HTML and CSS better, all the hard work paid off. I gained a lot of experience working on my website. Lots
						of falures, things i couldn't understand how and why it didn't worked, learned things that I didn't know HTML and CSS had to offer, like importing fonts, navigation bars, and viewports(something very important). 
						<br/>
						<br/>
						Some skills I learned from making my website is:
						<br/>
						<br/>
						1) Became better at looking at my mistakes and bad habits<br/><br/>
						2) Became better at debuging and troubleshooting my problems<br/><br/>
						3) Learned to manage my frustration and keep focus on the task at hand (i very rarely get frustrated)

						Overall I have to say that I am happy with the outcome and the experience it brung. I learned new things through experience and I plan to keep on learning by adding new things to the website and 
						keeping it updated to show my skills as a web developer and to make the whole website as professional as possible.

					<p class="info">
						This was a game that i made for my VoTech class using Game Maker studio 2. The theme of the game was to make it into a puzzle game. This platformer is different then the rest. This platformer is challenging due to the camera. The camera
						spins and shakes if the player is moving. Its rotation depends if the player is moving backwards or forward, the camera rotates counter-clockwise when the player moves to the left and vice versa. some interesting things that 
						me and my partner added was the nostalgic sprites making the game look and feel like something from the 80's, and a gun that is and isn't used, it depends on the level that the player is in wether it has enemies or not.
						We also added 8 levels each increasing in difficulty. <br/><br/>
						things that I learned with this project:<br/><br/>
						1) Better understanding of the camera<br/><br/>
						2) Working with a teammate<br/><br/>
						3) Making sure the enemy doesn't fall of a platform<br/><br/>
						4) Better time management abilities

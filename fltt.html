					<h1 class="me">Fruit Loops</h1>
						<p class="info">
							i made this game by myself and it's okay. i made it using the drag and drop in game maker and to be completly honest, it's kind of bad. but this was at a time where i didn't know anything about game maker language.
							so the point of this game is to collect fruit loops to travel through time and defeat the evil future overlord while being chased by an army of R.O.B.'s. the cool thing about this game was that i was able to add in 
							a gun to shoot the R.O.B.'s and the ability for the R.O.B.'s to randomly spawn around the map. also the level design isn't so bad, just the player movement is slow and clunky and it can get annoying. overall it's a decent
							game but not bad for my first time with game maker drag and drop.<br/><br/>
							what i learned from this experience was:<br/><br/>
							1) Working better by myself<br/><br/>
							2) getting to know drag and drop<br/><br/>
							3) better time management <br/><br/>
